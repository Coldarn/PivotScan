PivotScan
=========

PivotScan is a minimal desktop app for collecting images from scanners, pivoting them, and exporting them to PDFs with pickable paper sizes, all while maintaining their correct sizes and aspect ratios.

The goals of the app are humble:
- Ease-of-use: no nested dialogs or menus, and no confusing, unnecessary options, just what-you-see-is-what-you-get image/PDF composition and exporting
- Precise sizing of scanned images into PDFs for 1:1 reproductions of original documents
